# Shell Optimization Specification

## Purpose

Define how `pi-rtk` optimizes shell command execution to reduce LLM token consumption while preserving normal shell behavior when optimization cannot be applied.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Pre-Execution Optimization Attempt

The system MUST attempt to optimize shell commands before execution.

#### Scenario: Optimization succeeds

- GIVEN a command submitted to the `bash` tool
- WHEN the optimization layer successfully produces an optimized command
- THEN the `bash` tool MUST execute the optimized command
- AND the original execution context, including working directory and environment, MUST be preserved

#### Scenario: Optimization cannot be applied

- GIVEN a command submitted to the `bash` tool
- WHEN the optimization layer cannot produce an optimized command
- THEN the `bash` tool MUST execute the original command unchanged
- AND command execution MUST continue without requiring agent intervention

### Requirement: `rtk`-Based Optimization

The system MUST perform shell optimization using the `rtk` rewrite mechanism.

#### Scenario: Rewrite delegation

- GIVEN a command submitted to the `bash` tool
- WHEN the system attempts shell optimization
- THEN the system MUST delegate rewrite generation to `rtk`
- AND the command executed by the `bash` tool MUST be the rewrite output when that rewrite succeeds

### Requirement: Bounded Optimization Latency

The optimization step MUST NOT materially degrade shell tool responsiveness.

#### Scenario: Optimization exceeds time budget

- GIVEN a command submitted for optimization
- WHEN the optimization attempt exceeds its allowed time budget
- THEN the optimization attempt MUST be abandoned
- AND the original command MUST be executed unchanged

### Requirement: Context-Visible User Bash Optimization

The system MUST attempt shell optimization for user-issued shell commands whose output is intended to be included in LLM context, using Pi's exported local bash operations helper.

#### Scenario: Supported context-visible user bash command

- **WHEN** a user executes a supported shell command using Pi's `!<cmd>` syntax while `pi-rtk` is loaded on Pi v0.60.0 or later
- **THEN** the system MUST attempt to optimize the command before execution
- **AND** the command MUST execute through the optimized path when optimization succeeds
- **AND** the optimized execution MUST delegate local bash operations to Pi's exported `createLocalBashOperations()` helper

### Requirement: Non-Disruptive Fallback For User Bash Optimization

The system MUST preserve normal Pi shell behavior when optimization cannot be applied to a context-visible user shell command.

#### Scenario: Unsupported context-visible user bash command

- **WHEN** a user executes an unsupported shell command using Pi's `!<cmd>` syntax while `pi-rtk` is loaded
- **THEN** the command MUST still execute using normal Pi shell behavior
- **AND** execution MUST continue without requiring user intervention

#### Scenario: Optimization infrastructure unavailable for context-visible user bash command

- **WHEN** a user executes a shell command using Pi's `!<cmd>` syntax and the optimization layer cannot be used because `rtk` is unavailable, errors, or exceeds its time budget
- **THEN** the command MUST still execute using normal Pi shell behavior
- **AND** the optimization failure MUST NOT block, crash, or disable user shell execution

### Requirement: Context-Excluded User Bash Bypass

The system MUST NOT apply `pi-rtk` optimization to user shell commands whose output is explicitly excluded from LLM context.

#### Scenario: Context-excluded user bash command

- **WHEN** a user executes a shell command using Pi's `!!<cmd>` syntax while `pi-rtk` is loaded
- **THEN** `pi-rtk` MUST NOT intercept the command for optimization
- **AND** Pi MUST handle execution using its normal context-excluded shell behavior
